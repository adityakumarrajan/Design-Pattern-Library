Decorator Pattern:

Allows you to modify an object code dynamically.
You should use it when u want to have capability of inheritance with subclass, but u need to add functionality at run time.
Its more flexible than inheritance.
Simplfies code because we add functionality using simple classes.
Rather than rewrite code you can extend your new code.

Advantage: Inheritance is static while composition is dynamic.
